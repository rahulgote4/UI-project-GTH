file another_page.html, and you should place it into the same folder where your first .html is. After
you have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load
another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use the
<a> and </a> tags in this exercise. Inside the tag <a> you need to use a href attribute that specifies
